## Hello!

Hello! My name is Joseph Bailey. I'm a Data Scientist currently managing a team of Data Scientists and Engineers at the BBC. I love exploring data, data visualisation, programming and helping others to get joy from the same things. My favourite languages are R and Python.

Much of my programming interest is geared toward geospatial visualisation and spatial-algorithms. I also have a passion for learning more about leadership in techincal roles and generative art.

Outside of this domain, I also like adventure racing and triathlons. 

## Background

I have worked at:

- BBC (current)
- Connected Places Catapult - formerly Future Cities Catapult
- Simon Fraser University
- Geotrace
- Apple

## Papers & Presentations

I have presented at a range of professional and academic conferences which have predominantly focused on the use of data in environmental science, urban science and transport modeling.
